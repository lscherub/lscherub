		<p style="font-size: 18pt;">Procrastination is a common problem that many people struggle with. It's the act of putting off important tasks in favour of less important one, or simply avoiding them altogether. This can be incredibly detrimental to our productivity, as it can prevent us from reaching our goals and achieving our full potential.
			So, how do we overcome procrastination and boost our productivity? Here are a few tips that can help:
			<br><br>
			Set clear goals and deadlines. When you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve, and when you want to achieve it, you're more likely to stay focused and motivated. Setting deadlines can also help you to stay on track and avoid procrastinating.
			<br><br>
			Break tasks down into smaller, more manageable chunks. When a task feels overwhelming, it can be tempting to procrastinate. But by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces, you can make it feel more manageable and approachable.
			<br><br>
			Create a schedule and stick to it. Having a schedule can help you to prioritize your tasks and ensure that you're making progress towards your goals. It's also important to stick to your schedule and avoid getting sidetracked by less important tasks.
			<br><br>
			Eliminate distractions. Distractions can be a major cause of procrastination. Whether it's social media, email, or the internet in general, it's important to eliminate distractions as much as possible when you're trying to be productive.
			<br><br>
			Be accountable to someone else. Sometimes, the best way to overcome procrastination is to be accountable to someone else. Whether it's a friend, a family member, or a co-worker, having someone to answer to can be a powerful motivator.
			<br><br>
			By following these tips, you can overcome procrastination and boost your productivity. It may not be easy, but with a little effort and determination, you can achieve your goals and reach your full potential.
